<h1 align='center'> Object Oriented Design Patterns </h1>

Design patterns are a way to solve commonly occurring problems in software engineering. They are reusable, tested solutions to certain software design problems like templates for how to solve a problem.

Let's start with an overview of the four pillars of object oriented programming.

**Abstraction** - It's about capturing the essence of real-world entities by focusing on their crucial characteristics. Abstraction helps in managing complexity and ensuring a clean design.

**Polymorphism** - This is the ability of objects to assume various forms and behaviors. It’s the essence of flexibility in OOP and leads us towards certain design principles we’ll touch on shortly.

**Inheritance** - A mechanism where one class inherits attributes and behaviors from another, fostering code reusability.

**Encapsulation** - Bundling data and the methods that operate on that data into one unit, it helps in keeping the internal details under wraps and ensures controlled interactions.

These design patterns are rigorously tested and have been used in various software projects; hence using them will help you avoid common pitfalls and save time. Let's look at some of the most commonly used design patterns.

## Creational Design Patterns

These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by controlling the object creation.
