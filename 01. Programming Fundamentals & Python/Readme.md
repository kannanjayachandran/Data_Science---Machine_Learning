<h1 align="center" style="color: orange"> Computer Science Fundamentals - Python Programming - Version Control (GIT) & Linux </h1>

We are starting the program with this section by learning 3 things;

- Fundamentals of computer science

- A programming language - Python

- Learning Linux and GIT

## Computer Science Fundamentals

This section serves as a general introduction to computer science concepts. It contains the following topics:

1. [Information representation - Storage](./Computer_Science_Fundamentals/B1.md)
<!-- links -->

## Python Language

Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose dynamic programming language that focuses on code readability. It is easy to learn and use. 

**[Python](./Python/Readme.md)**

## Linux and GIT

- **[Basic Linux commands](./Version_Control_&_Linux/Linux_commands.md)**

- [Version Control System & basic GIT commands](./Version_Control_&_Linux/VersionControl.md)

## Basic problem solving
