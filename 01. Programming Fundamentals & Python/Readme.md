In this section we will be learning 3 things;

- **Fundamentals of computer science**

- A programming language - **Python**

- **Linux** and **GIT**

## Computer Science Fundamentals

Computer science is the study of algorithms, computational systems, and the principles underlying the design of computer hardware and software. It encompasses a wide range of topics, including data structures, algorithms, computer architecture, programming languages, operating systems, artificial intelligence, and more.
