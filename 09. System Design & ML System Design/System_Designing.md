# System Designing

The following are some of the important points that should be considered while making a system design.

- **Scalability**: Scalability is the capability of a system, process, or a network to grow and manage increased demand. Any system should be scalable so that it can be easily extended to meet the growing needs of the organization.

- **Reliability**: Reliability is the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function. It is achieved by removing the single points of failure in the system by adding redundancy to the system.

- **Availability**: Availability is the proportion of time a system is in a functioning condition. It can be measured as a percentage of the total system downtime over the total time.

- **Efficiency**: Efficiency is the ability of a system to deliver the desired output with minimum resources. It can be improved by using efficient algorithms, writing efficient code, and using the right data structures.

- **Manageability**: Manageability is the ability of a system to be easily operated, administered, and maintained throughout its lifetime. It can be achieved by keeping the system simple and modular.

- **Serviceability**: Serviceability is the ability of a system to be easily repaired. It can be achieved by keeping the mean time to repair (MTTR) as low as possible.

- **Security**: Security is the ability of a system to protect data and resources from unauthorized access. It can be achieved by using encryption algorithms, firewalls, and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protocols.

- **Cost**: Cost is the amount of money spent on a system. It can be reduced by using open-source software, using commodity hardware, and using cloud computing.

- **Maintainability**: Maintainability is the ability of a system to be easily modified to fix errors, to meet new requirements, and to improve performance. It can be achieved by keeping the code modular and simple.

- **Portability**: Portability is the ability of a system to run under different environments without any modification. It can be achieved by using standard protocols and open data formats.

- **Usability**: Usability is the ability of a system to be easily understood and used by users. It can be achieved by keeping the user interface simple and intuitive.



## System Designing Process

The following are the steps involved in the system designing process.

- **Requirement Analysis**: In this step, the requirements of the system are collected from the users. The requirements are collected in the form of functional and non-functional requirements.

- **System Design**: In this step, the architecture of the system is designed. The architecture of the system is designed by decomposing the system into smaller components and defining the relationship between the components.

- **Implementation**: In this step, the system is implemented using the programming language. The implementation of the system is done by using the design patterns and best practices.

- **Testing**: In this step, the system is tested for its functionality, performance, and security. The testing of the system is done by using the unit testing and integration testing.

- **Deployment**: In this step, the system is deployed on the production server. The deployment of the system is done by using the continuous integration and continuous deployment tools.

- **Maintenance**: In this step, the system is maintained by fixing the bugs and adding new features. The maintenance of the system is done by using the version control system.
