# System Design & Machine Learning System Design

## System Design

System design is the process of designing the architecture, components, and interfaces for a system so that it meets the requirements. It is a process of planning a working model of the system so that final system can be developed with ease. 


<!-- 
1. System design : intro, importance, how to approach.
2. Machine learning system design 
3. Questions/case studies (both ml and other systems)

First we define system design, then fundamentals, then one or two case studies or interview questions {All the other system design interview questions would be in a separate folder and mentioned here} Then we define machine learning system design. Then its fundamentals, connect it with normal system design. Then Machine learning system design interview questions.
