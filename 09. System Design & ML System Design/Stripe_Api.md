# Stripe Api design

$\color{#F99417}\large \text{Q.}$ **Design an API for a simplified version of the Stripe payment processing system**

### Endpoints:

- Create a new customer account.

- Retrieve customer information.

- Update customer information.

- Delete a customer account.

- Create a payment intent.

- Confirm a payment intent.

- Retrieve transaction history for a customer.

### Request/Response Formats:

- For creating a customer account, you might use a POST request with JSON data containing the customer's information, and the response could include a customer ID.

- Retrieving customer information could be done with a GET request to a specific endpoint.

- Updating a customer's information could use a PUT request with JSON data for the changes.

- To create a payment intent, you may use a POST request with details like the amount and currency, and the response could include an intent ID.

- Confirming a payment intent might involve a POST request with payment details and the intent ID.

- Retrieving transaction history could be a GET request to a specific endpoint, possibly with query parameters for filtering.

### Security Considerations:

- Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.

- Implement user authentication and authorization to ensure only authorized users can access and modify their data.

- Consider rate limiting to prevent abuse.

- Implement proper error handling and validation to handle invalid requests or unexpected issues.

### Examples:

- For creating a customer account, a sample POST request might include the customer's name, email, and payment method. The response would provide a customer ID.

- To create a payment intent, a POST request could include the desired payment amount and currency. The response would include an intent ID and a client secret that's used for confirming the payment.

- Retrieving transaction history would return a list of transactions with details like transaction ID, amount, date, and status.
