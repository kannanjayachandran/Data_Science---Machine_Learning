<h1 align="center" style="color: orange"> Data Science - II </h1>

In [Data Science - I](../05.%20Data_Science-I/Readme.md) we learned what data science is, its applications, important terms in data science, and the data science process. We also covered the foundational mathematics required for data science and machine learning. In this section, we will look at some of the most important data science techniques and some basic machine learning algorithms.

## Data Science Techniques

In [Data Science - I](../05.%20Data_Science-I/Readme.md); we have seen the data science process. It describes how we approach a data science problem. When we talk about data science techniques, we are talking about the specific methods we use to solve a data problem. The following are some of the most important data science techniques:

- **[Regression Techniques](./Regression_Techniques.md)**

- **[Classification Techniques](./Classification_Techniques.md)**

- **[Clustering and Association Analysis Techniques](./Clustering_and_Association.md)**

## Machine Learning Techniques

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data.
