## Functions

A function is a mathematical relationship between two sets of variables (_independent variable or input and dependent variable or output_). It is usually denote by $\color{orange}f(x)$, where $\color{orange}x$ is the **input** and $\color{orange}f(x)$ is the **output**.   

- Functions are Similar to equations as functions also express relationships between variables. 

- A function may have multiple inputs, but each input yields only one output. Alternatively, multiple inputs can result in the same output, but a single input cannot produce multiple outputs.

- **Domain** of a function is the set of all possible inputs for the function, over which the function is defined (has defined outputs). 

- **Range** of a function is the set of all possible outputs for the function.

### Types of Functions

There are a huge variety of functions, let us look at some of the most common types of functions.

**1. Linear Functions**

![Linear function](./img/Linear_func.png)

 A linear function is a function that can be represented by a straight line when plotted on a graph. It has the form $\color{orange}f(x) = mx + b$, where $\color{orange}m$ is the slope of the line  and $\color{orange}b$ is the y-intercept.

 > **EG:** Consider the cost of a taxi ride, it charges a fixed amount $\color{orange}b$  and an additional cost per mile $\color{orange}m$.

 **2. Quadratic Functions**

 A quadratic function is a second-degree polynomial function of the form $\color{orange}f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$, where $\color{orange}a$ is not equal to zero.

 > **EG:** The trajectory of a projectile, like a thrown ball, can be modeled by a quadratic function due to the influence of gravity.

**3. Exponential Functions**

An exponential function is a function where the variable is an exponent. It has the form $\color{orange}f(x) = ab^x$, where $\color{orange}a$ (_base_) and $\color{orange}b$ (_rate of growth or decay_) are constants and $\color{orange}b$ is greater than zero and not equal to one.

> **EG:** The growth of a population can be modeled by an exponential function.

There are many other types of functions, such as logarithmic functions, trigonometric functions, and polynomial functions.

Functions can also be differentiated as **Linear** and **Non-Linear** functions. Linear functions models flatness and non-linear functions models curvature.

Slope is a measure of how steep a line is. It is defined as the change in the `y-coordinate` (vertical change) divided by the change in the `x-coordinate` (horizontal change) between any two points on the line. 
$$Slope = \frac{rise}{run}$$

**In simple terms it tells us how many units the line moves down for every unit we moves to the right**

### Note

- If a system of linear equations has a unique solution; then they are complete and non-singular.

- If a system of linear equation has infinite solutions; it is redundant and singular.

- if the system of linear equation has no solution; it is called Contradictory and singular.

The constants in the system of equation are not important in determining whether the system is singular or not. -->
