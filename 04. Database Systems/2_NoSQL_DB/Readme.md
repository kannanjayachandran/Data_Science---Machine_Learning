## Why non-relational databases came into the picture ?

During the 70s and late 90s, disk space was the primary concern. Consequently, preference was given to disk space over latency. This paved the way for the emergence of relational databases. They were designed to store data in a structured manner and ensure data consistency.

From the early 2000s, due to the internet boom, the volume of data started to increase exponentially. The focus then shifted from disk space to latency. As a result, preference was given to latency over disk space. This marked the rise of non-relational databases.

One significant development during this time was the decreasing cost of compute power and memory. Disk space and compute power became more affordable. This period also witnessed the growing popularity of distributed computing. Google revolutionized distributed computing with their MapReduce paper, leading to the birth of Apache Hadoop. All these advancements laid the foundation for the growth of non-relational databases.
