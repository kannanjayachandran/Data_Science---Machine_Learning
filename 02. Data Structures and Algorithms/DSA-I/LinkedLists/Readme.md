<h1 align="center"> LinkedLists </h1>

Linked lists are a linear data structure consisting of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference to the next node in the sequence. The first node is called the `head`, and the last node is called the `tail`. The `tail` node points to `null` or `None` to indicate the end of the list. Linked lists are dynamic data structures that can grow or shrink in size during execution. They are efficient for insertion and deletion operations, but accessing elements by index is slower compared to arrays.
