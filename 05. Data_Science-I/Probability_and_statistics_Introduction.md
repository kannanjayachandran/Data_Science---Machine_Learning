<h1 align="center" style="color: lightgrey"> Probability and Statistics </h1>

**Probability** is the mathematical framework used to model _uncertainty_. It provides a way to quantify and reason about uncertainty in various scenarios. It is the likelihood of an event occurring. Almost all the fundamental concepts of probability are covered here from both mathematical and applied perspectives. check the **[Probability](./Probability.md)** notes. 

**Statistics** on the other hand is the field that deals with collecting, analyzing, interpreting, presenting, and organizing data. It's a field that applies probabilistic concepts to real-world data analysis and decision-making. Probability theory is highly abstract and formalized, while statistics is more or less an applied mathematical discipline. Check the **[Statistics](./Statistics.md)** notes.
