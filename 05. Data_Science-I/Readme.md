<h1 align="center" style="color: orange"> Data Science - I </h1>

Data science is a diverse field that utilizes scientific methods, algorithms, and systems to extract valuable insights from both structured and unstructured data. It involves the use of tools such as **data mining**, **machine learning**, and **big data techniques**.

The concept of data science has a historical journey marked by evolving meanings and connotations. Initially, in the 1960s, it emerged as an alternative term for statistics. However, it wasn't until the late 1990s that computer science experts formalized this term. A proposed definition of data science recognized it as a distinct field encompassing three key facets: **data design**, **collection**, and **analysis**. Like computer science, data science has also evolved rapidly from the late 90's due to internet boom, distributed computing and cheap processing and storage.

## The Data Science Process

## Data

![Definition of data](./img/data_def.png)

- > **Set**: In statistics, the population you are trying to discover something about.

- > **Variable**: Measurements or characteristics of an item.

- > **Qualitative variable**: measurements or information about qualities.

- > **Quantitative variable**: measurements or information about quantities or numerical items.

Data, in essence, consists of factual information, encompassing numbers, words, measurements, observations, etc. 

### Qualitative and Quantitative data

**Quantitative data** is numerical data that can be measured and expressed as numbers. It is further divided into **discrete** and **continuous** data. This type of data consists of distinct, separate values, while continuous can take on an infinite number of values within a given range. It is often measured with great precision and can include decimal values.

**Qualitative data** deals with qualities and characteristics that cannot be measured in numerical terms. It is further divided into **nominal** and **ordinal** data. Nominal data represents categories or labels with no inherent order or ranking. While Ordinal data represents categories with a specific order or ranking but does not have a consistent interval between values. The differences between ordinal values are not meaningful.

### Real data and Simulated or Synthetic data

Real data is the data collected from real-world sources through surveys, sensors, interviews, etc. It would often be incomplete, noisy, and inconsistent. It is also difficult to obtain and expensive to collect.

Simulated data or synthetic data is artificially generated data that mimics real data. We generally use a known mathematical function or randomly sample from a known distribution to generate synthetic data. It is easy to obtain and cheap to generate.

## Machine learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that deals with developing algorithms and models that enable computers to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed, by consuming data and using statistical analysis to derive insights from it.

At the core of almost all machine learning model including Neural networks, lies a very simple mathematical problem; 

> **_Fit a given set of data points into an appropriate function; that identifies the important information in the data from noise, then make sure this function performs well on new data_**

We will cover machine learning in detail in the next section.

## Deep learning

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks (ANNs) to mimic the working of the human brain. It can learn complex representations of data and is used to solve complex problems such as image classification, speech recognition, natural language processing, etc. Recently deep learning has occupied the center stage in the field of AI. 

## Generative AI

Generative AI is a subset of deep learning that uses deep learning to generate new data. It can be used for creating text,  images, videos, music, etc. Generative AI contributes to the recent resurgence of AI and is used in a wide variety of applications such as image generation, text generation, music generation, etc.
