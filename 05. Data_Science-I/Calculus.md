Slope 

</h2>

Slope is a measure of how steep a line is. It is defined as the change in the `y-coordinate` (vertical change) divided by the change in the `x-coordinate` (horizontal change) between any two points on the line. 
$$Slope = \frac{rise}{run}$$

**In simple terms it tells us how many units the line moves down for every unit we moves to the right**

### Note

- If a system of linear equations has a unique solution; then they are complete and non-singular.

- If a system of linear equation has infinite solutions; it is redundant and singular.

- if the system of linear equation has no solution; it is called Contradictory and singular.

The constants in the system of equation are not important in determining whether the system is singular or not. -->
