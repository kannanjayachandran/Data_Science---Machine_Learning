## Data

![Alt text](./img/data_def.png)

> **Set**: In statistics, the population you are trying to discover something about.

> **Variable**: Measurements or characteristics of an item.

> **Qualitative variable**: measurements or information about qualities.

> **Quantitative variable**: measurements or information about quantities or numerical items.

Data, in essence, consists of factual information, encompassing numbers, words, measurements, observations, etc. It can be categorized into two primary types: **qualitative** and **quantitative**.

**Quantitative data** is numerical data that can be measured and expressed as numbers. It deals with quantities and can be used for statistical analysis. It is further divided into **discrete** and **continuous** data. This type of data consists of distinct, separate values. These values are typically whole numbers and cannot be subdivided further, while continuous can take on an infinite number of values within a given range. It is often measured with great precision and can include decimal values.

**Qualitative data** deals with qualities and characteristics that cannot be measured in numerical terms. It is descriptive in nature and provides insights into the "what" and "why" of a situation. It is further divided into **nominal** and **ordinal** data. Nominal data represents categories or labels with no inherent order or ranking. It's used for classification purposes, while Ordinal data represents categories with a specific order or ranking but does not have a consistent interval between values. The differences between ordinal values are not meaningful.

## Machine learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that deals with developing algorithms and models that enable computers to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed, by consuming data and using statistical analysis to derive insights from it.

Now that we know what data is, and what data science is, we need to learn the tools and techniques to perform data science. But for understanding almost all of them we need to have a solid understanding of the underlying mathematical concepts. So let us look at some of the important mathematical constructs.

## Deep learning and Generative AI

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks (ANNs) to mimic the working of the human brain. It can learn complex representations of data and is used to solve complex problems such as image classification, speech recognition, natural language processing, etc. Recently deep learning has occupied the center stage in the field of AI. Generative AI is a subset of deep learning that uses deep learning to generate new data. It can be used for creating text,  images, videos, music, etc. Generative AI contributes to the recent resurgence of AI and is used in a wide variety of applications such as image generation, text generation, music generation, etc.
