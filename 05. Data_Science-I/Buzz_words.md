## Data

![What is data](./img/data_photo.png)

Data, in essence, consists of factual information, encompassing numbers, words, measurements, observations, etc. It can be categorized into two primary types: **qualitative** and **quantitative**.

Quantitative data is numerical data that can be measured and expressed as numbers. It deals with quantities and can be used for statistical analysis. It is further divided into **discrete** and **continuous** data. This type of data consists of distinct, separate values. These values are typically whole numbers and cannot be subdivided further, while continuous can take on an infinite number of values within a given range. It is often measured with great precision and can include decimal values.

Qualitative data deals with qualities and characteristics that cannot be measured in numerical terms. It is descriptive in nature and provides insights into the "what" and "why" of a situation. It is further divided into **nominal** and **ordinal** data. Nominal data represents categories or labels with no inherent order or ranking. It's used for classification purposes, while Ordinal data represents categories with a specific order or ranking but does not have a consistent interval between values. The differences between ordinal values are not meaningful.

Now we need to have a solid understanding of the underlying mathematical concepts to move forward, so let us look at some of the important mathematical constructs.
