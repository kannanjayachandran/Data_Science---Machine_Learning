# Markdown Style 

Since this project heavily uses markdown, it is important to follow a certain style. This will help in maintaining consistency and readability. These may not be best or standard practices. But, it is important to follow a certain style.

1. Prefer markdown over HTML whenever possible.
2. For centering heading and giving color to it;

```markdown 
<h1 align="center" style="color: orange">Content</h1>
```
Heading color : Orange or light grey. 

3. For centering image;

```markdown
<p align="center">
  <img src="src/img.png" alt="Image" width="200" height="200">
</p>
```

5. For equations inline, use orange color. For equations in block, no color.
