1. What do you mean by factorial of a number and what is the intuition behind it?

    **ANS** The factorial of a number is the product of all the integers from 1 to that number. For example, the factorial of 5 is 1*2*3*4*5 = 120. Factorial is not defined for negative numbers and the factorial of zero is one, 0! = 1 (representing empty arrangements ie.; no objects). Factorials grow very fast. While 5! is 120, 10! is already 3.6 million.

    **Intuition** The intuition behind the factorial is that it represents the number of ways in which you can arrange n objects. For example, if you have 3 objects, there are 3! = 6 ways in which you can arrange them.

    **Why 0! = 1?** The factorial of zero is defined as 1 because there is only one way to arrange zero objects. If there are no objects, then there is only one way to arrange them, namely, doing nothing. When it comes to 0, there are no positive integers less than 0. In mathematics, an _empty product_ (a product with no factors) is defined as 1. So, following this definition, 0! = 1.
