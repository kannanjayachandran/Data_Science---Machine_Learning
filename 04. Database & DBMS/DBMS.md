<h1 align="center"> Databases Management Systems </h1>

DBMS is a software package designed to define, manipulate, retrieve and manage data in a database. It also defines rules to validate and manipulate this data. SQL is used along with the DBMS package to interact with a database. The most popular DBMS's are MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, MongoDB, Redis, Firestore, etc.

_DBMS is a semester long course in most of the universities for undergraduate students. So, we will not go into the details of DBMS. We will only learn the basics of DBMS and SQL._

## Why use database over file system ?

- **Data integrity** : Databases are designed to ensure that data is always in a consistent state and that transactions are ACID compliant {Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability}. This is not the case with file systems.

- **Data sharing** : Databases are designed to allow multiple users to access and manipulate data at the same time.

- **Data security** : Databases are designed to allow multiple users to access and manipulate data at the same time.

- **Data abstraction** : Databases are designed to allow multiple users to access and manipulate data at the same time.

- **Data independence** : Databases are designed to allow multiple users to access and manipulate data at the same time.

- **Data redundancy** : Databases are designed to allow multiple users to access and manipulate data at the same time.

## Database Normalization

Database normalization is the process of structuring a relational database in accordance with a series of so-called normal forms in order to _reduce data redundancy_ and improve data integrity. It was first proposed by Edgar F. Codd as an integral part of his relational model.

Normalization entails organizing the columns (attributes) and tables (relations) of a database to ensure that their dependencies are properly enforced by database integrity constraints. It is accomplished by applying some formal rules either by a process of _synthesis_ (creating a new database design) or _decomposition_ (improving an existing database design). The most popular normal forms are 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF, 4NF, 5NF, 6NF, etc.
