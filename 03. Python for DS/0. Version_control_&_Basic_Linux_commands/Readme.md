# Version Control and Basic Linux Commands

Not only from data science or machine learning perspective, but also from a software development perspective, it is important to keep track of the changes you make to your code. This is where version control systems come into play. Version control systems are software tools that help a software team manage changes to source code over time. I will be using git and GitHub for this purpose.

Most of the time, we will be working on a remote server or some kind of distributed system So, we will also need to know basic Linux commands to navigate through the file system and perform some basic operations.
