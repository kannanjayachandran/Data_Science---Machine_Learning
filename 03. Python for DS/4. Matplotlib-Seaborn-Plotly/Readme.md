## Matplotlib 

Matplotlib is a comprehensive python library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in 2D and 3D. It has seamless interop with NumPy and SciPy. **`matplotlib.pyplot`** is an api (It is actually a state based interface of matplotlib) that provides a MATLAB-like plotting framework. Here I want to show some examples of using `matplotlib.pyplot`. See this [Notebook](./Matplotlib_notebook.ipynb) for more details.
