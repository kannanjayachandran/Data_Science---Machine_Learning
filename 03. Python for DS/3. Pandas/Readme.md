<h1 align="center"> Pandas </h1>

Pandas is a python library that makes working with “relational” or “labeled” data both easy and intuitive. It is excellent for the following types of data:

- Tabular data with heterogeneously-typed columns, as in an SQL table or Excel spreadsheet

- Ordered and unordered (not necessarily fixed-frequency) time series data.

- Arbitrary matrix data (homogeneously typed or heterogeneous) with row and column labels

- Any other form of observational / statistical data sets. The data need not be labeled at all to be placed into a pandas data structure

It provides two primary data structures: 1-Dimensional `Series` and 2-Dimensional `DataFrame`. Some things pandas does well are;

- Handling missing data

- Size mutability (can insert and delete columns and rows)

- Powerful and flexible `group-by` functionalities

- Ability to work with flat files, Excel files, databases, HDFS formats, and many other data formats

- Time series specific functionalities
