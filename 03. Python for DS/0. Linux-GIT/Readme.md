<h1 align="center" style="color: orange">Linux - GIT</h1>

Almost all operating systems are either Unix based or has some kind of bash shell associated with them. Especially, when we dealing with server grade or data center grade machines, we will be using Linux based operating systems. So, it is important to know some basic Linux commands. Knowing how to write scripts for automation is a big plus when it comes to data science.

Not only from data science or machine learning perspective, from software development perspective, it is important to keep track of the changes you make to your code. This is where version control systems come into play. Version control systems are software tools that help a software team manage changes to source code over time. I will be using git and GitHub for this purpose.
