<h1 align="center"> Matplotlib - Seaborn </h1>

This section acts as a quick reference for Matplotlib and Seaborn. For more details about data visualization, see [this](../../05.%20Data_Science-I/Data_visualization.md) notebook.

## Matplotlib 

Matplotlib is a comprehensive python library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in 2D and 3D. It has seamless interop with NumPy and SciPy. **`matplotlib.pyplot`** is an api (It is actually a state based interface of matplotlib) that provides a MATLAB-like plotting framework. Here I want to show some examples of using `matplotlib.pyplot`. See this [Notebook](./Matplotlib_notebook.ipynb) for more details.

## Seaborn

Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. Compared to matplotlib, seaborn is easy to work with and it has a lot of built-in functions for different types of plots.
