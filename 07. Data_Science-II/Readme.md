## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. EDA is used to understand what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task. It is a good practice to understand the data first and try to gather as many insights from it.
