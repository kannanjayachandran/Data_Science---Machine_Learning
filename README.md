<h1 align="center">Full Stack Data Science</h1>

**Data science** is a vast multidisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, mathematics, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from all sort of data.

**Full-stack data science** refers to a comprehensive approach to the field of data science. It encompasses the entire data science stack {from data collection and preprocessing to model building and deployment}.

> I am an undergraduate computer science engineering student specializing in _**Artificial Intelligence**_ and _**Machine learning**_. This repository contains the **code samples** { Jupyter notebooks }, **datasets**, and **notes**. Minor/Toy projects would be added in their respective repository itself. **Major projects** would be added to separate repositories and linked [here](./Major_Projects.md).
