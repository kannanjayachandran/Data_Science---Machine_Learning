<h1> Full-Stack Data Science </h1>

</div>

**This repository contains the code samples, Jupyter notebooks, datasets, and other resources for the Full-Stack Data Science program. Minor projects would be added to this repository as I progress through the course and Major projects would be added to separate repositories. The course would be divided into Modules. As of now there won't be any notes other than the Jupyter notebooks. In this Full stack program I would be learning Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Neural Networks, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and other related topics. I would be using languages like Python, R, and SQL. (Python would be the primary language). This course would cover Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, NLTK, and others. For data visualization, sofwares like Tableau and power BI would also be covered. For Data Engineering, big data tools like Hadoop, spark, BigQuery, and others would be covered along with some data pipeline tools like Appache Airflow. Ulitmately devOps tools like necessary cloud services, Docker, Kubernetes, and others would be covered later.**

- Ps: I may add some notes in the future.
