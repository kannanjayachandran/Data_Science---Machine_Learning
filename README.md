# Full-Stack Data Science

## Introduction

---

This repository contains the code samples, Jupyter notebooks, datasets, and other resources for the Full-Stack Data Science program. Minor projects would be added to this repository as I progress through the course and Major projects would be added to their own repositories. The course would be divided into Modules.
