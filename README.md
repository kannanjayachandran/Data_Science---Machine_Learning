**Data science** is a vast multidisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, mathematics, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from all sort of data.

> I am an undergraduate computer science engineering student specializing in _Artificial Intelligence_ and _Machine learning_. This repository contains the **code samples** { Jupyter notebooks }, **datasets**, and **notes** I prepare while learning **`Full-Stack Data Science`**. I would be updating this repository as I learn new topics. _Minor projects_ would be added in this repository itself within the modules or inside a Project folder. **Major projects** would be added to separate repositories and linked [here](./Major_Projects.md).
