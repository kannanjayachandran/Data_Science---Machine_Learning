**Data science** is a vast-multidisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, mathematics, systems and domain knowledge to extract valuable insights from data. **Full-stack data science** refers to a comprehensive approach to the field of data science (End-to-End).

This repository contains the **code samples** { Jupyter notebooks }, **datasets**, and **notes**. **Major projects** created as a part of this is available [here](./Major_Projects.md).

> _I am a final year undergraduate **computer science engineering** student specializing in **`Artificial Intelligence`** and **`Machine learning`**._
