# Full Stack Data Science

</div>

**Data science** is a vast multidisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, mathematics, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from all sort of data.

This repository contains the code samples, Jupyter notebooks, datasets, and notes I prepare for the Full-Stack Data Science program. This is simply a documentation of my learning journey. I would be updating this repository as I learn new things. _Minor projects_ would be added in this repository itself within the modules or inside a `Project` folder. **Major projects** would be added to separate repositories and linked [here](./Major_Projects.md).
