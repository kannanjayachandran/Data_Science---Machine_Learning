This repository contains the code samples, Jupyter notebooks, datasets, and notes I prepare for the Full-Stack Data Science program. This is simply a documentation of my learning journey. I would be updating this repository as I progress through and learn new things. Minor projects would be added in this repository itself within the modules or inside a `Project` folder. Major projects would be added to separate repositories. I am referring more than one course and multiple books, articles and documents.
