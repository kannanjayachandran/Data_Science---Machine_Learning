## 1. Kadane's Algorithm

Kadan's algorithm is used to find the maximum sum of a contiguous sub-array within a one-dimensional array of numbers. It can be solved in linear time complexity, while the brute force approach will take quadratic time complexity. It is a greedy and dynamic programming algorithm.
