<h1 align="center"> Searching </h1>

Searching is the process of finding a particular element in the given data structure. It is one of the most common operations performed on data structures. 

There are mainly two types of searching algorithms:

- **Linear search**

- **Binary Search** and its variants
 

 ## Problem set - I

1. Iterative and recursive implementation of Binary Search { Ascending order }
2. Binary search implementation { Descending order }
3. Order agnostic binary search
4. Modified binary search to find the lower bound
5. Modified binary search to find the upper bound
6. Find the first and last occurrence of an element in a sorted array
7. Find the first and last occurrence of a character in a sorted array
8. Find the number of times a number occurs in a sorted array
9. Find the number of times a sorted array is rotated
10. Searching in sorted-rotated array
11. Search in nearly sorted array
12. Find the floor of a given number in a sorted array
13. Find the ceiling of a given number in a sorted array
14. Next alphabet in a sorted array of characters
15. Search in infinite sorted array
16. Find the first occurrence of 1 in a sorted array of 0s and 1s
17. Minimum different element in a sorted array
18. Find the peak index in a mountain array
19. Find the maximum element in the mountain array
20. Search in bitonic/mountain array
21. Find in mountain array
22. Search in sorted matrix
23. Find the minimum and maximum indices in a sorted-rotated array
24. Search insert position
25. Floor of the square root of a number
