![Queue](Queue.png)

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. The elements are inserted at the rear end and removed from the front end. The operations are performed in the following order:

1. **Enqueue**: Add an element to the rear end of the queue.
2. **Dequeue**: Remove an element from the front end of the queue.
3. **Front**: Get the element at the front end of the queue.
4. **Rear**: Get the element at the rear end of the queue.

Queues are used in various applications like CPU scheduling, disk scheduling, and printer queue management.
