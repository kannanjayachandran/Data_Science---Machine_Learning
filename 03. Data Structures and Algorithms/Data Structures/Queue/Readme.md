![Queue](Queue.png)

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. The elements are inserted at the rear end and removed from the front end. The operations are performed in the following order:

1. **Enqueue**: Add an element to the rear end of the queue.
2. **Dequeue**: Remove an element from the front end of the queue.
3. **Front**: Get the element at the front end of the queue.
4. **Rear**: Get the element at the rear end of the queue.

Queues are used in various applications like CPU scheduling, disk scheduling, and printer queue management.

## Types of Queues

1. **Simple Queue**: A simple queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO principle.

2. **Circular Queue**: A circular queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO principle. In a circular queue, the rear end is connected to the front end.

3. **Priority Queue**: A priority queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO principle. In a priority queue, the elements are inserted based on their priority.

4. **Double-ended Queue (Deque)**: A deque is a linear data structure that allows insertion and deletion of elements from both the front and rear ends.
